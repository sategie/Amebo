## Project Goals

The Amebo app was designed as a social media platform to share interesting content with other people. It promotes social interaction by giving users the ability to comment on posts, like posts and follow users whose posts they find interesting.

## Agile Methodology

An agile approach was adopted in designing this project.

The various themes were broken down into Epics which were in turn broken down into a total of 25 User Stories.

These User Stories were then broken down into 6 iterations for planning purposes.

The User Stories were completed in order of importance, with the features needed for a MVP(minimum viable product) completed first.

The Kanban Board showing the overall planning for the User Stories can be found in the screenshots below:

## Project Planning

The project planning utilized the five basic concepts of UX design: Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton and Surface.

### Strategy
This project is aimed at providing a platform to share interesting content and interact with other users. 

The name **Amebo** is a term in Nigerian 'pidgin English' meaning 'to gossip'.

A parrot was used as the landing page image to accurately describe the main idea behind the app.

### Scope
The scope of the project has to do with the requirements, specifications and features.

The major features in the project are:

- Signup: Users have the ability to click the Signup button to create an account.
- Login: Users who already have an account can click the Login button in order to access more features in the app.
- View Posts: All users (irrespective of logged-in status) can view posts from users.
- Create/Edit Posts: Logged in users have the ability to create new posts and edit their existing posts.
- Comment/Edit Comments: Logged in users have the ability to comment on posts and edit comments they created.
- Follow/Unfollow Users: Logged in users have the ability to follow and unfollow users whose post(s) they find interesting.
- View/Edit Profile: Logged in users can view the profile of others and also view/edit their own profiles e.g if they want to upload a profile picture.
- Logout: A logged in user has the option to log out if they are done using the app.

### Structure
The structure of the project relates to how the content and functionality are designed to ensure that users can easily navigate the app.

The project is designed such that when a user logs in for the first time, they see the home (landing) page.
The landing page provides basic information about the app .i.e informing users they need to create an account if they want to access certain features.
After the user logs in, the home page displays what features the user is able to access.

### Skeleton
The skeleton plane shows the wireframes for the project. The wireframes are displayed below:

### Surface
The surface plane shows the completed app. The wireframes designed for the project were used to create the final app.

The color structure of the project is a mixture of shades of green and black. For some of the buttons, there are also shades of gray and blue.
The major factor considered when choosing the color combinations was readability.

The Roboto font was used througout the project to provide a comfortable viewing experience for end users.
The font sizes are also large enough to enable users view the contents of the app.
